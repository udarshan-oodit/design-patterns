### Scenario
- We own multiple pizza shops, one in joburg on in cape town
- We should be able to order different flavored pizzas
- Each shop should be able to add its own twist on the pizza
    - Eg. Cpt adds extra spice on a margherita
    

### Factory Method
- Allows a class to defer instantiation to subclasses
- Allows a `pizzaShop` to defer instantiation to `capeTownPizzaShop`, `joburgPizzaShop`
