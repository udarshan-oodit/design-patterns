### Scenario
- Weâ€™re creating a furniture shop simulator
- We have two (could be more) products: chairs and tables 
- We have two (could be more) styles of products: modern and old
- We need a way to create individual furniture objects so that they match other objects of the same family (style).

### Abstract Factory
Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
